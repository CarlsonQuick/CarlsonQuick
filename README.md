## About Me

Experienced Software Devloper and Manager with a strong history of driving test automation and pragmatically improving team and codebases to allow more consistent and sucessful products.  Broad experience in building, testing, and maintaining full stack highly available systems.  A proven track record of leading and improving highly technical feature teams (on sight and distributed), and driving broad change across an organization.  Experienced interviewer, have helped build remote teams and driving local hiring loops.  Active and dedicated mentor who genuinely enjoys seeing other people succeed, and focuses on building up and supporting team members over personal sucess.  Comfortable public speaker with experience in presenting technical material both to layman and expert audiences.  A strong personal preference to proven working solutions over buzzword compliant miracle cures, and methodical, evidence based changes to systems and processes.  Flexible helper, less concerned about who's job it is, or what the title means, and more interested in getting things done in a way that is sustainable and effective.
